**Today's Progress**: I add contents module. So Instructors can create update and delete contents

**Thoughts** I've started Mooc coding since May 1st, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve a bug with Module path can not work after a lot of attempts and hours spent. After that I will add Contents Instructors can create update and delete contents.But It is not compleated yet in Managing modules and contents with template.
