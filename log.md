 Day 1: May 23, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I add contents module. So Instructors can create update and delete contents

**Thoughts** I've started Mooc coding since May 1st, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve a bug with Module path can not work after a lot of attempts and hours spent. After that I will add Contents Instructors can create update and delete contents.But It is not compleated yet in Managing modules and contents with template.

Today's Progress: Teacher can drag-and-drop for reordering contents and module. Index page worked with show all course and can see course overviews.

Thoughts I learned about howto use CsrfExemptMixin and JsonRequestResponseMixin deal with reorder contents and module.integrated by JQuery. And use CourseListView from courses.views with index page. Represent All Courses now.

 Day 3: May 27, Monday

Today's Progress: Add student feature ie. student registration, enroll courses, student access the course contents

Thoughts I learned about adding student registration,enrolling in course, how to setting models many-to-many relationships students models - course models associate. If any Views have LoginRequiredMixin in () that means only logged in users can access the view, Using LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = reverse_lazy("") in settings.py to redirect the user to after a successful login. Rendering different types of content (Text,Image,Video and File) has differently management.
